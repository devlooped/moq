			The following example shows how to add a new setup to an object

			<code>
				// Typed instance, not the mock, is retrieved from some test API.
				HttpContextBase context = GetMockContext();

				// context.Request is the typed object from the "real" API

				// the mock that "owns" it
				Mock&lt;HttpRequestBase&gt; request = Mock.Get(context.Request);
				mock.Setup(req => req.AppRelativeCurrentExecutionFilePath)
