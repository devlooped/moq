        // Once that changes, some setups may have more than one inner mock. This possibility
        // has already been accounted for in Moq's internals, but not in this interface:
        // The `InnerMock` property should really be replaced with an `InnerMocks` one.
        //
        // Before making this change, let's wait a little longer to see whether it can be avoided.
        // This is a distinct possibility since fixing Moq's recursive verification algorithm
        // may do away with the need to expose the "inner mock" concept altogether. It would be
        // a pity to add `InnerMocks`, only to have both properties become obsolete soon after.
